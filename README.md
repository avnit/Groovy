The purpose of this project is to call the google API and return a valid results. I only need top 4 in each category 
1. News 
2. Latest Technology 
3. sports 
4. business News 


I generally read only these things on train daily. so if i have it in my website i can just open it daily and have one look
at all the things . I do want it to be more specific , if i read it once never shows in the result again.

Stage 2 

Add a dictiory to the page and so it gives me a new word daily bottom of the news section . 
These words i like to be from the word list that i do not know . 

Logic : i have a file with all the data that i need . It is as simple as displaying one result in the view from the file and 
move viewed from that file to another file . When all the words are done then go to dictonary.com web API and download all the new words 
added . At this point this will send me an email with all the word added.
